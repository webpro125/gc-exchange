  <h2>Global Consultant Exchange Services (GCES) Profile Builder</h2>


  <h3>Welcome! For your profile to become searchable quickly, please complete the following three
    actions.</h3>

  <ol type="A">
    <li><strong>Complete the GCES Profile Builder</strong><br>
      The 5-Step Profile Builder helps you create a secure on-line consulting profile that is
      viewable
      by approved government contractors in the GCES network. The Profile Builder takes about an
      hour
      to complete. As you navigate forward through each step, your profile information is
      automatically saved. This allows you to exit the system and return to complete the process.
