<p>Welcome to the 5-Step GCES Profile Builder. The Profile Builder helps you create a secure on-line consulting profile. Your consulting profile is only viewable by approved Companies in the GCES network. The Profile Builder takes 30-45 minutes to complete. As you navigate forward through each step, your profile information is automatically saved. This allows you to exit the system, and to return later to complete the process. </p>

<p>When youâ€™re finished, your personal profile will be searchable by companies looking for consultants with your skills. After you complete the initial Profile Builder, you can edit, update, and expand on your profile at any time in the future using your personalized consultant dashboard. Learn more about the Profile Builder Requirements below.
