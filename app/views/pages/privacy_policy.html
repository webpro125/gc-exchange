  If we seek to use the information we obtain about you in other ways, we will provide specific notice and request your consent at the time of collection.</p>

<h3>Information We Share</h3>
<p>When you apply for a consulting assignment through the site or publicly post your resume to our resume database, our clients will have access to information about you and your potential interest in consulting opportunities. Those clients may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a consulting assignment through the site, the information supplied by you becomes part of the GCES database but also may become part of our clients’ databases. Similarly, if your resume is downloaded by a client, your resume may become a part of the client’s database. In these instances, the use of such information by the client will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company’s use of your information.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable Aggregate Data about our users and use such anonymous Aggregate Data to prepare reports for our users. “Aggregate Data” is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together. Aggregate Data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals. For example, a client may purchase a report from GCES that states the number of cost analysts with at least five years’ experience that live within a certain geographic area. All such reports sold only contain Aggregate Data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.</p>
<p>Other than instances where users opt to publicly post their Personal Information to our resume database or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason. When posting consulting opportunities and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display. All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the site or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which GCES is not responsible.</p>
<p>Where you have provided Personal Information on a site that is “hosted” or “co-branded” by another company then that information will be made available to both GCES and the hosting/co-branding company. GCES is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information. You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.</p>
<p>We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>GCES also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of GCES or other users of the site.</p>
<p>In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of GCES.</p>
<h3>Resume Privacy Options</h3>
<p>Posting your resume on the site puts you in front of hundreds of clients with open consulting positions each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the site in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.</p>
<p>We know that our users have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting their resume on the Internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, GCES has two levels of resume privacy from which you can choose. Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not your resume can be viewed by third parties. GCES will still collect, use or disclose anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standard Posting</strong><br>
This option gives you the most visibility to the broadest client audience possible by making your resume searchable in our resume database. If you select this option, any registered client user who purchases access to the database can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume).</li>
<li><strong>Private Posting For Apply Online Only</strong><br>
This option allows you to post your resume on the site without having it searchable by or viewable to clients. The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for consulting opportunities without retyping your information, and you provide your resume only to those clients you are specifically interested in.</li>
</ol>
<p>We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying clients, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, clients who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.</p>
<h3>About Cookies, Tracking Choices, and Third Party Advertisers</h3>
<p>A “cookie" is a text file that website send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon," is also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail.</p>
<p>GCES uses cookies and other similar technologies for the convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. GCES also uses cookies to store non-personally identifying information about you such as past consulting opportunities viewed and searches conducted by your computer in a cookie that it places on your computer. We do this in order to present you with recommendations based on your interests and experience as expressed previously through your searches. Lastly, GCES uses cookies to ensure the proper functioning and efficiency of our site. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please be aware, however, that some GCES features or services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
<p>GCES permits third party cookies on its site. For example, third party tools located on the site, including those that allow for social media sharing, may use cookies to remember user preference settings. GCES also uses web analytics services provided by third parties, which use cookies to collect non-personal information about details of our users’ visits to the site (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the site. These third party web analytics services provide us with reports based on this information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with the site.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies who may place or access cookies on your computer hard drive to distinguish your web browser uniquely and to keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the webs pages on which the ads appeared. These companies may use information about your visits to these sites and to other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on our site or on other, third party, sites. We also may give third party advertisers the ability to tailor their advertisements on our site using demographic and preference information we provide to them in aggregate form. This information does not identify you individually.</p>
<p>These companies operate under their own privacy policies and GCES encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies. GCES does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by third party advertisers.</p>
<h3>Update Your Account Information</h3>
<p>You may access, update and amend Personal Information included in your online account at any time by logging into your account and making the necessary changes. You may also delete your account, including your Personal Information and any resumes from our databases at any time by logging in to your account and making an account deletion request. Deleting your account will remove your Personal Information and resumes from our databases. However, if you have applied for a consulting opportunity in the past, that particular client will still be able to access your resume. Further, you will not be able to delete data held by third parties that already have accessed and downloaded your information or resume. In addition, we will retain anonymous Aggregate Data for uses described above. Please allow up to thirty days to process your account deletion request.</p>
<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
<p>Our site may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites are operated by companies not owned by GCES. These other sites or linked third-party sites may have their own privacy notices, which you should review if you visit those sites. We are not responsible for the content of any site not owned by GCES, any use of those sites, or those sites’ privacy practices.</p>
<h3>How We Protect Personal Information</h3>
<p>GCES maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist us in protecting the Personal Information we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.</p>
<p>Please note that no electronic transmission of information can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always remain private. As a user of the site, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the site, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the site.</p>
<p>To further protect yourself, you should safeguard your GCES account user name and password and not share that information with anyone. You should also sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to our site. Please note that we will never ask for your GCES account user name or password via email.</p>
